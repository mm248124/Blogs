Letâ€™s talk about MobaXterm, a ultimate toolbox for remote computing.
I have started using Mobaxterm in CIT 160 class by the recommendation of the professor.
In a single Windows application, it provides loads of functions that are tailored for
* programmers
* webmasters
* IT administrators
* pretty much all users who need to handle their remote jobs in a more simple fashion.

MobaXterm provides all the important remote network tools such as:
* SSH
* X11
* RDP
* VNC
* FTP
* MOSH
* any many more
Unix commands 
* bash, ls, cat, sed, grep, awk, rsync, ...

I use mobaxterm for school and work.

One challenge that I came across was updating firmware of network switches that are on remote sites.

Mobaxterm has Built in Servers:
* TFTP
* FTP
* HTTP
* SFTP

Using this Servers, I can SSH to the switch and download the firmware from my laptop or workstation and upgrade the switch.

MobaXterm also offers customizable interface that can meet user's needs.
