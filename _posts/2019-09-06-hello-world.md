Lab A was definitely not as easy as I remember it from CIT 160 class. 
We did not work with docker and this was new to me. 
I did hear about docker but have not worked with it before. 
In order to run docker on windows 10 pro, Hyper-V and Containers Windows features must be enabled. 
The commands were not hard and there was a step by step instructions to follow. 
I did not pay attention but turns out that when u enable Hyper-V hypervisor it disables other hypervisors on that machine. 
This is because Hyper-V is a type 1 hypervisor where as VirtualBox or VMware are type 2. 
I lost access to all my VirtualBox VMs which I was using for another class called CIT 425.
