# How to use GitHub

__Clone your GitHub__

* git clone URL_here

__Create new branch__

* git checkout -b branch_name

	*  "checkout -b" creates a new branch within the local version of the repository and copies all the files. 

__Add new files to newly created branch__

## This will add all files in the directory

* git add . 

## Add specific file

* git add file_name

__Commit added files__

* git commit -m "Commit message here"
	
__Push files to repo__

* git push --set-upstream origin your-branch-name
	
## Once your branch is pushed to repo, make a pull request between "master" and "your-branch" on the github website.
	
## Once someone reviews the pull request, merge the new branch with master.

## Confirm files are merged and delete the branch.
