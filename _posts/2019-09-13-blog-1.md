Lab 1 was definitely easier than Lab A. Lab A was confusing because the docker was new to me and I did not have any experience with it. 
Similar to Lab A the commands in Lab 1 were not hard and there was a step by step instructions to follow. 

For example:

If you want to create a new container named lab1

$ docker run -it -p 8080:80 --name lab1 ubuntu:latest bash

Breakdown of the command:

● Docker run = Run a command in a new container

● -it = Container should have interactive terminal

● -p = Map local port 8080 to port 80 inside the container

● --name = Assign a name to the container

● Ubuntu:latest = Image to be used

● Bash = Run the bash command when the container is built

I did manage to find a solution to my problem of needing both Hyper-V and VirtualBox on the same machine.
If you are also running a Windows 10 pro on your machine and need both hypervisors to work, then take a look at this url:

https://finsterbt.com/switch-between-hyper-v-and-virtualbox-on-windows-10/

This solution will create a new boot menu option that reboots the computer with Hyper-V temporarily disabled. 
This will allow switching between Hyper-V and VirtualBox, VMWare Workstation, VMWare Player, or any other type 2 hypervisor by rebooting and choosing to temporarily disable Hyper-V.
