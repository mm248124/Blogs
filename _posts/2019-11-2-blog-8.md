Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code software tool created by HashiCorp. 
It enables users to define and provision a datacenter infrastructure using a high-level configuration language known as Hashicorp Configuration Language, or optionally JSON.

Let's talk about using Terraform to automate aws infrastructure setup.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
First install terraform.

Here are the steps to install terraform on Linux:

# Install unzip
* sudo apt-get install unzip

# Download latest version of the terraform (substituting newer version number if needed)
* wget https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/0.12.13/terraform_0.12.13_linux_amd64.zip

# Extract the downloaded file archive
* unzip terraform_0.12.7_linux_amd64.zip

# Move the executable into a directory searched for executables
* sudo mv terraform /usr/local/bin/

# Run it
* terraform --version 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How to use terraform:

# Create files with ".tf" extension.
* vi main.tf

# Write your code in there.


Here is an example of terraform to deploy an EC2 Instance.

provider "aws" {

  region = "us-west-2"

}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {

  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"

  instance_type = "t2.micro"

}

When first starting to use Terraform, you need to run terraform init to tell Terraform to scan the code, figure out what providers youâ€™re using, and download the code for them.

* terraform init

The plan command lets you see what Terraform will do before actually doing it.
* terraform plan

The apply command does everything that plan showed.
* terraform apply
