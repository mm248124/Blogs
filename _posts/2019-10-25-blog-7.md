I have already talked about Ansible Playbook in my previous blog. However, I only talked about how to run Ansible on a local host. 

What if you want to run Ansible playbook on a remote host?

This way you don't have to copy Ansible Playbook to the host. You don't have to have all the tools installed on the host.

This gives you opportunity to run Ansible Playbook no matter where your location is.



Here are the Requirements to run Ansible Playbook on a remote host.

* Set up ssh connection to remote host.

* Upload your public ssh key to the hosts.

* Make sure your private ssh key has correct permissions
	* chmod 400




1) Install ansible on your laptop or device that you will use to push Ansible Playbooks from.
	* sudo apt-get install ansible

2) Go to /etc/ansible/hosts on your device and add the host IP or Domain name.
	* Remove "#" in front of "webservers" to enable it
	* Add hosts under webservers

3) Run the Playbook on your device with the following command.
	* ansible-playbook --private-key=<your-private-key> <ansible_file_name> -u <username> -k --ask-become-pass

Here is the break down of the command:

	* Set "--private-key" to your ssh private key
	* Set "-u" to your username
	* "-k" will require password for ssh key
	* "--ask-become-pass" will require root password to get privileged access
